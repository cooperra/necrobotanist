# The Necrobotanist

As the Necrobotanist, commanding the duality of life and death, raise both plants and the dead to overcome platforming challenges.

You've been dying to win the State Fair, or at least your creations have been. But first you have to get there.

# How to Play

Raise the dead, then command them to fertilize your plants. If you need to move a plant, raise the dead to reclaim its life force.

* Move: Arrow Keys / Left-Stick
* Jump: Z / Bottom face button
* Throw Seed: X / Left face button
* Command the Dead: C / Top face button
